Savaged-Zen Battery Options sysfs interface
-------------------------------------------
What is it?
-----------
- An overcomplicated sysfs interface that allows the switching between SBC
and non-SBC in the HTC battery driver.
- It's overcomplicated for a reason, because implementing more variables to
it in the future (IE if we want to change kernel tunables through sysfs) -
it will be extremely simple to implement.

Usage
-----
int sysctl_batt_sbc - range from 0 to 1. 0 turns SBC off, 1 turns SBC on
SBC is disabled by default unless CONFIG_HTC_BATTCHG_SBC_DEFAULT is set.

changing at runtime:
echo 1 > /sys/kernel/batt_options/sbc/sysctl_batt_sbc (turn it on)
echo 0 > /sys/kernel/batt_options/sbc/sysctl_batt_sbc (turn it off)
