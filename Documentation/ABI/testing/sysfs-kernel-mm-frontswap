Description:
		/sys/kernel/mm/frontswap/ contains a number of files which
		record a count of various frontswap operations (sum across
		all swap devices):
			succ_puts
			failed_puts
			gets
			flushes
		In addition, reading the curr_pages file shows how many
		pages are currently contained in frontswap and writing this
		file with an integer performs a "partial swapoff", reducing
		the number of frontswap pages to that integer if memory
		constraints permit.
