What:		/sys/kernel/mm/zcache
Date:		July 2010
Contact:	Nitin Gupta <ngupta@vflare.org>
Description:
		/sys/kernel/mm/zcache directory contains compressed cache
		statistics for each pool. A separate pool is created for
		every mount instance of cleancache-aware filesystems.

What:		/sys/kernel/mm/zcache/pool<id>/zero_pages
Date:		July 2010
Contact:	Nitin Gupta <ngupta@vflare.org>
Description:
		The zero_pages file is read-only and specifies number of zero
		filled pages found in this pool.

What:		/sys/kernel/mm/zcache/pool<id>/orig_data_size
Date:		July 2010
Contact:	Nitin Gupta <ngupta@vflare.org>
Description:
		The orig_data_size file is read-only and specifies uncompressed
		size of data stored in this pool. This excludes zero-filled
		pages (zero_pages) since no memory is allocated for them.
		Unit: bytes

What:		/sys/kernel/mm/zcache/pool<id>/compr_data_size
Date:		July 2010
Contact:	Nitin Gupta <ngupta@vflare.org>
Description:
		The compr_data_size file is read-only and specifies compressed
		size of data stored in this pool. So, compression ratio can be
		calculated using orig_data_size and this statistic.
		Unit: bytes

What:		/sys/kernel/mm/zcache/pool<id>/mem_used_total
Date:		July 2010
Contact:	Nitin Gupta <ngupta@vflare.org>
Description:
		The mem_used_total file is read-only and specifies the amount
		of memory, including allocator fragmentation and metadata
		overhead, allocated for this pool. So, allocator space
		efficiency can be calculated using compr_data_size and this
		statistic.
		Unit: bytes

What:		/sys/kernel/mm/zcache/pool<id>/memlimit
Date:		July 2010
Contact:	Nitin Gupta <ngupta@vflare.org>
Description:
		The memlimit file is read-write and specifies upper bound on
		the compressed data size (compr_data_dize) stored in this pool.
		The value specified is rounded down to nearest multiple of
		PAGE_SIZE.
		Unit: bytes
